# Recommendation Engine Using Association Analysis

**Association Rule Analysis on Cosmetics E-commerce Data**

This repository contains a notebook that explores association rule analysis on a dataset from an online cosmetics store. The notebook aims to uncover patterns and associations between products and users' behavior within the e-commerce platform. The following provides an overview of the problem and the dataset used:

**Problem Overview: E-commerce Behavior**
E-commerce has transformed the way people shop by leveraging electronic platforms to facilitate buying and selling goods and services. This notebook focuses on analyzing the behavior data from a medium-sized cosmetics online store, where customers can browse and purchase products. Understanding user behavior patterns can provide valuable insights for personalized marketing, product recommendations, and improving the overall customer experience.

**Dataset Overview: Cosmetics E-commerce Behavior**
The dataset used in this analysis contains behavior data collected over a two-month period (October and November 2019) from the cosmetics online store. Each row in the dataset represents an event, capturing interactions between products and users. The events include various types of user-product engagements, such as views, clicks, add-to-cart actions, and purchases. A session may contain multiple purchase events if multiple products are bought in a single order.

The dataset provides a many-to-many relationship between products and users, allowing for the discovery of associations between product combinations and user behaviors. The goal of this notebook is to leverage association rule mining techniques to identify interesting relationships and patterns, such as frequently co-purchased items or commonly followed sequences of user actions.

The notebook utilizes the following libraries to perform the analysis:
- `pandas` for data manipulation and preprocessing
- `seaborn` and `matplotlib.pyplot` for data visualization and plotting
- `mlxtend.frequent_patterns` for mining frequent itemsets using Apriori algorithm
- `mlxtend.association_rules` for generating association rules from frequent itemsets

The notebook covers various steps, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and association rule mining using the Apriori algorithm or other relevant algorithms. The resulting association rules provide insights into the purchasing habits and preferences of customers, enabling businesses to optimize marketing strategies, enhance cross-selling opportunities, and improve overall sales performance.
